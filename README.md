# Blockchain-Based Rental Property Management

A decentralized application (dApp) for managing rental properties using blockchain technology. This system streamlines the rental process from property listing to maintenance requests while ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.

## Overview

This system uses smart contracts on the blockchain to manage the entire rental lifecycle. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create a trustless environment where landlords and tenants can interact with confidence, knowing that contractual terms are automatically enforced.

## Core Components

### Property Listing Contract

This smart contract maintains a decentralized registry of available rental properties.

**Features:**
- Property details (location, size, amenities)
- Rental price and deposit requirements
- Availability status
- Property history
- Image/document IPFS links

### Tenant Verification Contract

A secure way to verify tenant credentials and rental history without compromising privacy.

**Features:**
- Background check integration
- Rental history verification
- Income verification
- Privacy-preserving credential sharing
- Reputation scoring system

### Lease Agreement Contract

This contract codifies the terms between landlord and tenant, automatically enforcing conditions.

**Features:**
- Digital signatures for all parties
- Rent payment automation
- Security deposit management
- Cancellation and renewal terms
- Late payment handling

### Maintenance Request Contract

Tracks and manages property maintenance issues from submission to resolution.

**Features:**
- Maintenance ticket creation
- Service provider assignment
- Work verification by tenant
- Payment release to service providers
- Maintenance history tracking

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum/Polygon
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity
- **Front-end:** React.js with Web3.js/ethers.js integration
- **Document Storage:** IPFS for decentralized storage of images and documents
- **Oracle Integration:** Chainlink for external data feeds (property values, credit checks)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Truffle/Hardhat for development
- IPFS client (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-rental.git

# Install dependencies
cd blockchain-rental
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

## Usage

### For Property Owners

1. Connect wallet and register as a property owner
2. Add property details and set rental terms
3. Review tenant applications
4. Sign lease agreements
5. Monitor rent payments and property maintenance

### For Tenants

1. Connect wallet and complete verification process
2. Browse available properties
3. Submit rental applications
4. Sign lease agreements
5. Pay rent and submit maintenance requests

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature requirements for major contract changes
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Circuit breakers for emergency situations
- Formal verification of critical contract functions
- Regular security audits

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with decentralized identity solutions
- Tokenization of rental property shares
- Reputation-based rental incentives
- Insurance smart contracts for landlords and tenants
- DAO governance for community properties
